		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>I am an experienced Digital Product Manager who has worked with some of the largest and most familiar brands in the country, including the last four and a half years at one of Canada's top five web properties (as measured by traffic). The work environments I like to help create are agile with an emphasis on iterative product improvements based on rapid experimentation informed by extensive data collection and analysis. I believe in frequent, regular, direct contact with users and customers. You need both qualitative and quantitative data to have a chance of understanding the whole picture.</p>

<p>When something is not working right, I can't stand it. I can't be comfortable until we've fixed it. After that, I get to improve it.</p></div></div>
